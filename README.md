# Tic Tac Toe Game with React.js

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using React.js. It comes with the following features:

- Customizable board size
- Customizable number of matches to win
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

## Optimized Matching Algorithm

One of the key features of this Tic Tac Toe game is its optimized matching algorithm. Instead of checking all blocks for matches every turn, it uses an optimized approach that takes the time complexity of O(board size). This ensures efficient gameplay even on larger boards.
